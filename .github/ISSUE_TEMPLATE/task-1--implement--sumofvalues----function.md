**Description**

The first task is to create a working version of the `sumOfValues()` method.  This method takes two parameters, an array of `double` values, and the number of values in this array.  This method should then perform the mathemetical summation operation on the values.  It should assume that we want to sum all values from index=0 to index=numValues-1 of the array.  The function should return the summation of the values as its result.

**Suggested Solution**

This should be a relatively straight forward task.  We went over several examples of processing an array in a function like this in our lectures for the unit this week.

**Additional Requirements**

- The array of values should not be modified as a result of calling this function.
- Further, you should declare the parameter correctly so that the compiler will absolutely not allow you to even consider the possibility of modifying this parameter inside of the function.
