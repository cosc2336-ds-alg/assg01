**Description**

The second task is to implement the `calculateMean()` function.  This function takes the same parameters and has the same signature as the function from your first Issue for this assignment.  This function need to calculate the mean of the given values and return this as its result.


**Suggested Solution**

You should not be writing a loop in this function since you are required to reuse the `sumOfValues()` function in this implementation.

**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to reuse your implementation of the `sumOfValues()` function when implementing the `calculateMean()` method.  It will be considered incorrect if you do not demonstrate code reuse here.
