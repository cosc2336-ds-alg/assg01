**Description**

Implement the `squareOfValues()` function.  This function works similarly to the one you should implement in the previous Issue #3.  This function does not return a result.  The function only has 2 input parameters, an array of `double` values to be worked with, and the number of values in this array.  The function should simply square each value in place in the array.

**Suggested Solution**

Make sure that the calculation is done in place in the given array.  The results of your calculation need to be returned implicitly in the given array for the function.

**Additional Requirements**

- The array of values needs to be modified in place in this function.
- The resulting values after this funciton finishes will be the squares of the originally passed in values.
- You are required to (re)use the `<cmath>` library and call the `pow()` function
  to raise the values to the second power (e.g. to square them).
